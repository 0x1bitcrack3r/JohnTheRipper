 * UNIX password using hmac_sha1
 * This is PBKDF1 from RFC 2898, but using hmac_sha1.
 *
 * The format of the encrypted password is:
 * $<tag>$<iterations>$<salt>$<digest>
 *
 * where:
 * 	<tag>		is "sha1"
 *	<iterations>	is an unsigned int identifying how many rounds
 * 			have been applied to <digest>.  The number
 * 			should vary slightly for each password to make
 * 			it harder to generate a dictionary of
 * 			pre-computed hashes.  See crypt_sha1_iterations.
 * 	<salt>		up to 64 bytes of random data, 8 bytes is
 * 			currently considered more than enough.
 *	<digest>	the hashed password.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * To be FIPS 140 compliant, the password which is used as a hmac key,
 * should be between 10 and 20 characters to provide at least 80bits
 * strength, and avoid the need to hash it before using as the
 * hmac key.
