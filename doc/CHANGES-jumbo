The following changes was made since Jumbo-5 (in reverse chronological order):

* SHA0: use the basic function names since they're static anyway. This format 
is good as a template for unsalted formats and sha1_gen_fmt_plug.c is good for 
salted ones, as they don't contain any SSE2 or such complications. (magnum)
* RAR: Another early reject found by Milen. This was already in place but we 
might bail out just a little sooner with this test. (magnum)
* RAR: Added a reject test from Milen (magnum)
* xsha512-opencl: eliminate byte address store (Myrice)
* RAR: reverted experimental early reject, it produced false negatives. Added 
lots of comments to unrar code, from original sources. (magnum)
* RAR: Fix EVP and unrar memory leaks. Early reject if rar_decode_number would 
return > MaxNum. Experimental fuzzy early rejection found by Milen. (magnum)
* Added a new rule, to reject a word unless it is a specific length. This could 
be done in the past with 2 rejection rules. Updated the doc/RULES file, and 
rules.c. Pretty trivial code change. (JimF)
* Add SHA-256 OpenCL kernel. (Dhiru Kholia)
* bash completion updates http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-dev/2012/05/12/4

does not include modes that also has generate() (magnum)
* New (hidden) options: 
--list=[inc-modes|rules|externals|ext-filters|ext-modes] to be used by bash 
completion as well as GUI's and other things. (magnum)

instructions by using OpenSSL EVP instead of low-level calls. Added inline 
storing of RAR data in input file when files are small enough. Added lots of 
self-tests. Default to use same length tests as cRARk. Changed format tag from 
$rar3$ to $RAR3$ to enforce re-running rar2john. Moved slow code from 
set_salt() to get_salt() and keep all allocations during the whole run. (magnum)

affect performance. (magnum)
* Remove requirement of cert8.db files for "no master password" check in 
mozilla2john. Remove "no master password" check from mozilla_fmt. (Dhiru Kholia)
* Signed-off-by: myrice <myrice@myrice-laptop.(none)> (myrice)
* Mozilla_fmt bugfix: globalSalt array was smaller than needed, causing 
segfaults. This should be forwarded to the FireMasterLinux project. (magnum)
* OMP support for mozilla format. ~1.5x faster using 3 cores. (Dhiru Kholia)
* Fast cracker for Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey master passwords. 
(Dhiru Kholia)
* common-opencl.c: Add -DDEVICE_IS_CPU to the build options when applicable, 
for self-adjusting kernels. (magnum)
* ssha-opencl: Move salt and datai buffers preparation away from crypt_all() 
just for good measure. There might be a miniscule speedup for single-salt. 
(magnum)
* New pre-built intrinsics for latest sse-intrinsics.c icc version 12.1.0 
(magnum)
* sse-intrinsics.c: Take advantage of some SSE2 and SSSE3 intructions if 
available http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-dev/2012/03/21/4 (followup) (Solar)
* Fixed over-allocation in all OpenCL SHA-1 kernels. They used 320 bytes per 
key buffer instead of just 64. (magnum)
* Use BSD version of tcphdr (patch by Erik). (Dhiru Kholia)
* Add make target for vncpcap2john.cpp (Dhiru Kholia)
* Improved vncpcap2john. Works for RFB 3.7 and 3.8 protocol versions. Works 
with TightVNC and RealVNC servers. 3.3 RFB support is TODO. (Dhiru Kholia)
* XOP for MD5/MD4/SHA-1 (Solar)
* Improvement: get the LWS and KPC from john's config file. Improvement: check 
if group size is valid. Cosmetic: changes in benchmark comment. See commit: 
9d3fe1414e. Performance: put all working variables in __local memory address 
space. Fixed: allow temp buffer to use all the available local memory. Fixed: 
use small KPC values when running on CPU. On real cracking tasks, big values 
behaves badly. Fixed: format and algorithm names. Fixed: copyright information. 
(Claudio André)

* Add one more SIP hash. (Dhiru Kholia)
* Add OMP support for sip format. (Dhiru Kholia)
* OpenCL cryptsha512 (Claudio André)

input CRACF.TXT file into JtR compatible format. racf2john is currently TODO. 
(Dhiru Kholia)
* Add LDFLAGS to SIPdump build target (magnum)
* SIPdump added. Needs libpcap-dev so for now it's a separate make target "make 
SIPdump" (magnum)
* Integrate SIPcrack 0.4 into JtR. SIPdump.c is still to be integrated. (Dhiru 
Kholia)
* Add OMP code to RACF based on magnum's changes to RAR format. Fix non-OMP 
build of RACF. (Dhiru Kholia)

version can successfully crack non-hp archives with method "store" ("m0b") 
without spawning unrar. Also fixed a bad memory leak. rar2john: Pick best 
candidate from RAR file. Prefer stored files over compressed, and prefer 
smaller files over larger. (magnum)

John itself for lengths gt 125) (magnum)
* All hmac formats: Support key lengths >64 (magnum)
* IPB2: OMP & intrinsics support, over 3x speed (magnum)

(magnum)
* Added hmac-sha1 and hmac-sha256 formats. Added wikipedia self-tests to 
sha-md5 (magnum)
* Wordlist.c hack for reading candidates from a pot file: 1. if --wordlist 
given without a name, use default pot file 2. if wordlist name (after 1) ends 
in .pot, parse it as such (magnum)
* HDAA intrinsics, 3x original speed (magnum)
* md5-mmx.S: new interface needed for multi-limb (>55 bytes) crypts (for HDAA)

* Jim's new SHA-1 intrinsics. Uses 16x4 buffer instead of 80x4. Improved "make 
testpara32" to compare asm figures too. Updated SHA1_SSE_PARA for 16x4 code. 
New pre-compiled intrinsics. (magnum)
* Make all sse2i targets use x86-sse.h. Add new test target 
linux-x86-64-32-sse2asm. (magnum)
* loader.c: restore the defined-out block for DES bare hashes with whitespace 
salt. (magnum)
* loader.c: fix for --user=<uid> when loading pwdump files (magnum)
* DragonFly SHA formats: Add 64-bit versions (in same format files: dual 
structs) (magnum)
* MSCHAPv2 salt() alignment (magnum)
* Drop x86-ssei.h in favor of x86-sse.h, add tests that disable intrinsics for 
gcc older than 3.4.6 (the oldest we know work at all) and fallback to asm. This 
means the sse2/sse2i targets now work similar to 64/64i for newer versions of 
gcc, that is, sse2i just means "precompiled intrinsics". (magnum)
* SHA-crypt-256/512: Change benchmark to only output raw figure since there is 
no difference between one/many salts. Also output "rounds=5000". (magnum)
* Change #include "omp.h" to #include <omp.h> in a number of formats. (magnum)
* IPB2: fix in binary(), it was reading twice the size of ciphertext and 
probably overwriting something. (magnum)
* Deprecated raw-md5 thin (moved to unused) in favour of thick version (magnum)
* Crypt-SHA2 formats using OpenSSL and with OMP support (magnum)
* DragonFly BSD crypt-SHA2 formats added. Should work for 32-bit "versions" of 
the bugs in them. (magnum)
* ssha opencl kernel update (Samuele)
* Bugfix in trip_fmt.c (from latest CVS version) (solar)
* sapB & sapG: trim trailing spaces from (truncated) plaintext. Raise sapG 
plaintext length (for UTF-8 encodings of long passwords) Warn if 
--encoding=utf8 is used/not used depending on format: these formats are well 
defined in that aspect. (magnum)
* HDAA: OMP support (magnum)
* sapG: Various bugfixes. New cleaning mechanism. Seems to work fine now. 
Intermediate key will never be longer than 192 bytes, decreased max number of 
limbs to three. Dropped the internal UTF-8 conversion. It was never 
appropriate. sapG now behaves like any other 8-bit format. If you want UTF-8, 
feed UTF-8. (magnum)
* sapB: Various bugfixes. Use enc_strupper() for proper uc of UTF-8, but init 
the Unicode system in a way so it does not uppercase double-s (magnum)
* sap_prepare.pl renamed to sap2john.pl and changed not to pad salt (magnum)
* ssh2john: Detect if private keyfile has no password (Dhiru)
* RawSHA1: Optimised set_key() for some 17% speedup. (magnum)
* hmac-MD5 optimisations. 32-bit set_key(). (magnum)
* john-1.7.9-jumbo-5-opencl-3.diff (Samuele)
* make testpara target, for determining best SSE_PARA values (magnum)
* sapB and sapG: re-worked valid() for variable salt length. We still support 
the old format (padded with spaces to 40 characters) but also non-padded. 
(magnum)
* sapG: Added MMX/SSE/intrinsics. Decreased salt length to 36 (12 x UTF-8) 
(changed self-test hash). (magnum)
* Fixed bug in unicode.c where specifically giving --enc=raw did not work as 
expected (magnum)
* Added MMX/SSE/intrinsics to sapB as well as lots of optimisation. (magnum)
* john-1.7.9-fastrip-1.diff This patch speeds up DES-based tripcode cracking by 
making use of JtR's bitslice DES implementation, including its OpenMP 
parallelization. (solar)
* drop cmpt_cp.pl and mkdumb16.pl (will be placed in the separate patch) 
(magnum)
* Oracle11: Added intrinsics (magnum)
* mssql05 hash functions size 5 & 6 (magnum)
* MD5_std vs intrinsics / arch.h PARA fixes. Never disable SSE for MD5, revert 
to 4x instead. (magnum)
* raw-md5u final fixes (all linux builds pass test suite) (magnum)
* Raw-MD5-unicode made thick again, using much faster code (2x dynamic) (magnum)
* Salted-sha1: performance tweaks (magnum)
* Dynamic md4 final fixes (JimF)
* Dynamic MD5_X2 md4 fixes (JimF)
* Bug fixes to lotus5 (OMP builds) and both mssql formats (MMX builds) (magnum)
* mysqlSHA1 32-bit set_key() for SSE2 (magnum)
* Simplification of differences between SSE2 and SSE2i code.  In nsldap, there 
were problems with 32 bit SSE2. (JimF)
* Lotus5: Use the passed in format pointer, and avoid having to forward declare 
the static global. Has added benefit of always appearing the same way in all 
init() functions of all formats, no name differences. (JimF)
* Cygwin OMP builds were not building x86-sse.o properly, without this change. 
(JimF)
* Added MD4 to dynamic. 7 crypt functions were deprecated. These 7 'crypt' 
functions were replaced with 'crypt_md5' functions. 4 new md4 crypt functions 
added. Updated the dynamic conf file, and the dynamic documentation. Added 5 
new builtin types to dynamic (using md4). (JimF)
* pass_gen.pl added to run/ directory. This has only been available in separate 
patches (like the test suite creation scripts) until now, and that version was 
not up to date. This is a gem for testing stuff. (magnum)
* XSHA: Added support for OMP and/or intrinsics (magnum)
* Reduced verbosity for normal test targets and added verbose ones (magnum)
* External filter now truncates at format's max length. Turn off wordlist 
memory buffer if an external filter is used (a modification would trash the 
buffer if a word got longer) (magnum)
* Correct truncation for NT formats. This time with no performance loss (magnum)
* Added copyright statement. (bartavelle)
* Changes Makefile test targets for Test Suite 1.10 (magnum)
* Update src/hmacMD5_fmt_plug.c (JimF)
* dynamic non contiguious number issues BE (JimF)
* Update src/dynamic_utils.c (JimF)
